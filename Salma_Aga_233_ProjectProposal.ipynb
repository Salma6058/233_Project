        "\n",
        "Online shopping has changed how we buy things, making it more convenient to shop from the comfort of our homes. But for businesses, understanding what makes people buy things online is crucial. This study looks at a dataset of online shopping behavior to figure out why people buy things online and how businesses can use this information to sell more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Data:\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset has information from 12,330 shopping sessions, each representing one person's visit to an online store over a year. It includes details like which pages they visited, how long they stayed on those pages, and metrics like bounce rates and page values, which help measure how likely someone is to buy something.\n",

        "# Data Collection:\n",
        "This data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and it's been carefully put together to make sure it's not biased towards any specific advertising campaigns or special events. This way, we can get a true picture of how people shop online.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Cases:\n",
        "There are over 10,000 instances where people didn't end up buying anything and about 2,000 instances where they did. Each instance tells a story about someone's online shopping experience, giving us insight into what influences their decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Variables:\n",
        "The dataset has lots of different pieces of information, like how many different types of pages someone visited, how long they spent on those pages, and metrics like bounce rate (which shows how many people left the site without doing anything) and page value (which shows how much a page is worth in terms of sales). It also includes things like whether it was a special day, what operating system they were using, and whether they were a new or returning visitor.\n",
